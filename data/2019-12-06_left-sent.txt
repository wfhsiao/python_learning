I can't believe it!
What happened?
I didn't win the prize.
You mean in the contest?
Yes. I'm seeing red!
Calm down.
Don't get angry.
Our friend Sam won.
Why didn't I?
Matt, you're green with envy.
It's just not right.
I tried so hard.
I know.
But maybe he did, too.
He didn't.
So Sam's win came out of the blue?
Yes, everyone was so surprised.
Well, Sam must be tickled pink about it.
He is very happy.
At least someone is.
You can try again in the next contest.
I don't know.
This experience wasn't good.
Oh, look! Sam just posted a picture of his prize.
Oh. Now I'm really feeling blue.
You can make your English more colorful with idioms.
Some idioms even have colors in them.
You see red when you are very angry about something.
When you feel blue, you are sad.
But when you are very happy, you are tickled pink.
If something comes out of the blue, it often happens suddenly.
You are surprised by it.
Maybe someone has something special, and you really want it.
Then you are green with envy.
Try using a colorful idiom today!
Hi, friends, welcome to Let's Talk in English.
Happy Friday.
My name's Pauline.
Hey, guys, my name is Jay.
And today we have a LANGUAGE lesson.
That's right. Colorful Idioms.
Oh, idioms.
Those are always fun to learn.
I agree. Idioms are sayings that sound like they mean one thing but they mean something different.
For example, "it's raining cats and dogs" doesn't mean animals are falling from the sky out of the clouds.
No, of course not.
It just means that it's raining really hard.
What about I'm sick as a dog?
Oh, that just means you're really sick.
Right. Can you think of another idiom with an animal, Jay?
Sure. Uh, oh, you are quiet as a mouse.
Oh, yes, that just means I'm very quiet.
Although I don't think I am quiet as a mouse, Jay.
Uh, well, maybe not.
You're really not a quiet type of person.
You're more like a social butterfly.
Hey, good one.
Friends, social butterfly describes someone who really enjoys being with groups of people.
I guess I am a bit of a social butterfly.
Oh, I just thought of another one.
Pauline, are you an early bird or a night owl?
Oh, I'm a night owl.
I don't really like getting up early, but I really like staying up late.
Using idioms to describe people, actions or situations is a lot of fun.
It makes conversations more interesting.
But if you don't know them, they can be confusing.
Right. So that's why we like to have idiom lessons on our show.
Today we'll learn how to use colors to describe emotions and situations.
In fact, I think Jack is going to teach us some of those now.
(Chinese).
I can't believe it!
What happened?
I didn't win the prize.
You mean in the contest?
Yes. I'm seeing red!
Calm down.
Don't get angry.
Our friend Sam won.
Why didn't I?
Matt, you're green with envy.
It's just not right.
I tried so hard.
I know.
But maybe he did, too.
He didn't.
Wow, Matt seems really unhappy.
He sure does.
What happened?
Well, he was in some contest, and he lost.
He didn't win the prize.
Oh, that's too bad.
What kind of contest was it?
Was it some kind of art contest like a photography contest?
Oh, or was it a writing contest?
Actually, I'm not sure.
I didn't know he was in a contest.
But whatever it was, Matt really wanted to win, and he tried really hard.
Oh, I see.
So he's disappointed.
That makes sense.
Yeah, but he's not just disappointed or sad.
He's angry.
I mean he's seeing red.
He's really upset.
Oh, that's too bad.
Why do you think he's so angry about it?
Well, I guess he thinks it isn't fair.
He worked so hard to win, but the person who did win didn't even try that hard.
I see.
Although I also agree with Susie.
I don't think Matt's just mad because he thinks it's unfair.
I think he's also jealous.
He's really a little bit green with envy.
Yeah, Matt really wanted that first place prize.
Oh, and hey, Jack really wants to talk to us about that word, prize.
Go ahead, Jack.
(Chinese).
Pauline, can you think of any other situations where we might use this phrase, green with envy?
Good question, uhâ€”
Oh, uh, actually, I've got one.
Uh, when I walk onto an airplane and I see all of the rich people in the first class, I'm green with envy.
Oh, that's great.
I can understand why you're green with envy then.
Oh, because you're green with envy, too?
Yeah. Oh, and hey, you're green with envy.
That's today's Calendar Phrase!
You're green with envy.
You're green with envy.
(Chinese).
You're lucky.
You get to live on earth.
Oh. You're green with envy.
The Earth is so beautiful.
Oh! You're green with envy.
The people are so friendly.
I want to live on Earth, too!
Oh. You're green with envy!
Actually, I'm always green.
You're green with envy.
You're green with envy.
(Chinese).
Another fun Calendar Phrase.
I always enjoy those.
So do I.
Oh, hey, I thought of another animal idiom we use when someone is angry.
Oh, OK. Uh, so we learned the color idiom: seeing red.
But there's an animal idiom, too?
Yes. So if you're seeing red, then you are probably mad as a hornet.
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that one.
Friends, a hornet is like a bee.
So if someone is mad as a hornet or seeing red, that just means they are very angry.
So you should probably stay away from them.
Right. But Jay and I aren't angry, so you don't have to stay away from us today.
Although we do need to take a quick break.
So stick around.
We'll be right back.
