Welcome back, friends. Today we are talking about color idioms.
And speaking of colors, hey, Jay, what's your favorite color?
Oh, my favorite color is blue.
Uh, what about you, Pauline?
Oh, well, actually, I enjoy lots of colors, of course.
But my favorite color is green.
Well, anyways, though we should get back to today's conversation and see what other color idioms Susie and Matt use.
So Sam's win came out of the blue?
Yes, everyone was so surprised.
Well, Sam must be tickled pink about it.
He is very happy.
At least someone is.
You can try again in the next contest.
I don't know.
This experience wasn't good.
Oh, look! Sam just posted a picture of his prize.
Oh. Now I'm really feeling blue.
So remember Matt was hoping to win a contest.
He tried really hard to win.
And he thought he should win.
But—
But instead, his friend Sam won the prize.
And Matt is not happy about it.
In fact, he's angry and jealous.
He wanted the prize and he doesn't think Sam deserves it.
Hmm, "deserve" is a good word to learn.
If you deserve something, it means you should get it.
For example, if you do a good job, then you deserve to be paid.
Right. Here's another example.
If you don't study, you don't deserve to get good grades.
Well, here Matt worked really hard to win this contest.
Matt thinks he did the best, so he deserves to win.
But the judges don't agree.
They picked Sam.
Right. And Sam's win came out of the blue.
Everyone was really surprised that he won.
Interesting.
Hey, we're using this word, win, a lot today.
So, Jack, can you teach us more about it?
(Chinese).
Thanks, Jack.
So what do you think about this situation, Pauline?
Well, I understand how hard this is for Matt.
I'd be feeling blue if I was him, too.
I hate losing.
And it's extra hard if you think the judges weren't fair.
Yeah, that is hard.
But on the other hand, Sam is Matt's friend.
Maybe he should be happy for Sam.
Like Susie said, I'm sure Sam is tickled pink.
Right. It's not like Sam cheated.
So even if Matt thinks the judges made the wrong choice, that's not Sam's fault.
And as Sam's friend, maybe Matt should be more happy for him.
Of course that's easier to say than to do, especially when Sam is posting pictures of the prize Matt wanted.
Well, friends, how do you think you would feel if you were Matt?
And what would you do?
Well, this isn't our month's TALK ABOUT IT, but that doesn't mean you can't talk about it.
That's true. Of course not.
We hope you talk about it in English and talk about our many lessons in English.
Remember, the more you practice speaking English, the better you will get.
Yeah, it's OK if you can't remember every word from our lesson or if you make mistakes.
That's just part of the process.
But to help you remember the key words at least, we do always like to review those at the end of the lesson.
That's right.
So why don't we go ahead and do that now?
Here's your first key word for today.
see red.

Percy is seeing red.

Talia is angry at the dog.

All right, friends, those are your key words for today.
Keep on practicing. You're doing great.
And now it's time for us to watch today's conversation one more time together.
I can't believe it!
What happened?
I didn't win the prize.
You mean in the contest?
Yes. I'm seeing red!
Calm down.
Don't get angry.
Our friend Sam won.
Why didn't I?
Matt, you're green with envy.
It's just not right.
I tried so hard.
I know.
But maybe he did, too.
He didn't.
So Sam's win came out of the blue?
Yes, everyone was so surprised.
Well, Sam must be tickled pink about it.
He is very happy.
At least someone is.
You can try again in the next contest.
I don't know.
This experience wasn't good.
Oh, look! Sam just posted a picture of his prize.
Oh. Now I'm really feeling blue.
﻿(Music).
Ginger, what's wrong?
I feel blue.
Oh, why are you sad?
I entered a contest, and I lost.
Hmm. What contest?
Why didn't you tell me?
I read about the contest online, and I entered out of the blue.
Oh.
Well, what kind of contest?
A baking contest.
I made banana bread.
Did you use your secret recipe?
Yes, the one I shared with you.
Oh, well...
It's the best recipe ever. How could I lose?
Well, because I entered the contest, too.
And you won?
Yes. I'm tickled pink.
Well, I'm seeing red! Huh!
Don't be angry.
Everyone loved your recipe.
My secret recipe?
Yes! Look at my prize.
Ahh! I am green with envy!
﻿(Music).
So, Super Sentence Man.
Hey, are you enjoying the party?
Yes, I am, Roger.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
Oh, no, problem.
Hey, listen, make yourself at home.
Feel free to go anywhere in the house.
Roger.
Roger, this is so funny.
Uh, what's funny?
Your face in this picture.
I saw this picture on the wall over there.
And I laughed so hard.
I laughed so hard I cried.
But because in that—that's not—
She just used today's Super Sentence!
I did?
Yes!
The super sentence is:
I did something so hard.
You said:
I laughed so hard.
Yes, she laughed so hard at this picture of—
Oh, this is great, Roger.
Don't you understand?
How about you?
Just for fun.
Can you give me the super sentence in another way?
Uh, OK, sure.
Uh, I finished a sad book.
I cried so hard.
I finished a sad book.
I cried so hard.
Wow. That was great.
OK. Why? Men shouldn't cry?
What—what are you looking at me like that for?
No!
Like I said, it was great.
It was super!
That was a super sentence.
Nice job.
A super sentence every day will make your English great.
So what's so funny?
It's this picture. Look at the face he's making and the wig he's wearing.
Oh, wait a minute. Yeah, that fake hair is pretty funny.
You know, the longer you look at this picture, the funnier it is.
It's—OK, guys, guys, that's not me.
What?
That's—that's not—that's not—it's someone else's face.
That's my face.
It's not my face.
It's not a funny face.
This is not your funny face?
No, that's not a wig.
That's—that's real hair.
It's not your hair.
It's not a real wig.
No, it's—that's my grandmother.
What?
Whom I love and miss very much.
Oh!
Uh, well, um, she's—
Beautiful.
Yes, she is.
Oh, um, you have her smile.
Oh, stop.
Well, friends, we hope you enjoyed learning some of these color idioms today.
Of course, some of these we use more often than others.
Which one do you think we use the most?
Oh, I think "out of the blue."
That's definitely the most common.
I agree.
Well, friends, we hope this doesn't feel out of the blue, but we do need to say good-bye.
We'll see you tomorrow, OK?
Right here on Let's Talk in English, good-bye.
