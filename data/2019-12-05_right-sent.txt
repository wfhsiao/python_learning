Hey, friends, welcome back.
Today we're talking about the northern lights.
Have you ever seen the northern lights before?
It's an experience that you will never forget.
If you want to see them, maybe you can visit Finland or Scandinavia.
That's right.
Or maybe you can see them in Canada or Alaska.
Or if it's easier for you to go south, you could go to Australia, and you might be able to see the southern lights.
Wow, that would be great.
Well, I think Trina and Greg are talking about some other places you can visit.
So let's go back to them now.
There are many amazing places to see the northern lights.
Tell us about another place.
In Churchill, Canada, you can see the lights and polar bears, too.
I'd like that!
Near Fairbanks, Alaska, you can take a northern lights tour.
That would be fun.
It would!
And in Sweden, you can see the lights and stay overnight in an ice hotel.
What an amazing experience!
Wow, Trina really knows some amazing ways to see the northern lights.
Yeah, right?
Well, let's talk about the first one:
Churchill, Canada.
Where you can see polar bears.
Yeah. I don't know if I want to meet a polar bear.
Aren't they the biggest hunting animal?
Yes, that is for animals that live on land.
They're the biggest in the world.
Bigger than lions, tigers.
Bigger than all the other bears.
Isn't that cool?
Yeah, and dangerous, right?
No, just give them a lot of space and you'll be fine.
Well, if you say so.
Well, hey, let's talk about the next place:
Fairbanks, Alaska.
Oh, Alaska.
Now talking about big things, Alaska is the biggest state in the United States.
What an amazing place.
I would love to go to Alaska.
Even if there were polar bears there?
Yes, even if there are polar bears.
Alaska is so beautiful.
Can you imagine seeing the northern lights there?
Oh, that would be an amazing experience.
Definitely.
What an amazing experience.
And "What an amazing experience" is today's Calendar Phrase!

See, Jay? That old man danced with a polar bear.
Hmm, right.
Well, hey, what's the last place that Trina talked about on the show?
Sweden.
Friends, you might remember we already talked about Finland.
Well, Sweden is right next to Finland.
It's a part of Scandinavia.
That's right.
And in Sweden, you can stay overnight in an ice hotel.
Hey, that makes me think of Jack.
Well, I don't know if he's been to Sweden.
But he does want to teach us about that word, overnight.
(Chinese).
Thanks, Jack.
Well, I wonder what an ice hotel is like.
Oh, that's a good question.
Well, I guess, I mean it's a hotel made mostly out of ice.
Well, friends, we've learned some really good words today.

Welcome to the program, Trina Travel!
Thank you, Greg.
Have you ever seen the northern lights?
No, I haven't seen them, have you?
Yes, I went to a resort in Finland last winter and saw them.
Did you have to stay up late to see them?
Yes, but I didn't have to go outside.
I could see them through the glass roof of my igloo.
That sounds really cool!
There are many amazing places to see the northern lights.
Tell us about another place.
In Churchill, Canada, you can see the lights and polar bears, too.
I'd like that.

When can we see the northern lights, James?
Hmm. A popular time to see them is January to March.
Oh, but it's cold then.
Brrr!
Oh, yes, it's very cold.
You go to Finland to see them and stay in an igloo.
Oh, that's so cold.
If you go to Canada, you might see polar bears.
Wow, that's fun, oh, but scary.
If you go to Alaska, you can take a tour.
Yay! Follow me.
In Sweden, you can stay overnight in an ice hotel.
Oh, wow!
You can enjoy the northern lights in so many places.
Yes. But all of them are cold places. Brrr!

Well, don't forget to turn out the lights when you leave.
Get it?
Very funny. Huh-uh.
Yeah.

Family Time.
Hello, friends!
Today we are in the snow.
Now why are we in the snow? Because it is winter!
We are going to play in the snow today.
Join us on Family Time.
Kai Kai!
In the winter, there's often snow.
Snow is beautiful.
It is clean and white.
And it is cold.
Because it is cold, we have to wear warm clothes.
Everyone is getting dressed to go outside.
We are going to play in the snow.
Now it takes a long time to get dressed because there are a lot of clothes to put on.
Kai Kai, do you have everything?
I think I have everything.
Wait! I need my gloves.
Thank you.
I need a hat.
Oh, thank you.
OK, let's go outside.
Let's go! Yay!
Playing in the snow can be a lot of fun.
People can do many things in the snow.
You can make snow balls and throw them.
Or you can make a snowman.
Mei Mei, what are you doing?
I'm making a snow angel.
Wow. Even though it's cold outside, there are still many fun things we can do out here in the snow.
Whoa! Hey! Who threw that snow ball? Levi!
In the wintertime, many people enjoy doing different kinds of sports.
Many people enjoy skiing and snowboarding down hills and mountains.
Other people like to skate on the ice.
It is a lot of fun to be outside in the snow.
It is now time to go inside and drink something warm.
Whoa. Well, I am tired but we had a lot of fun out in the snow today.
Now it's time for us to enjoy a nice warm cup of hot chocolate.
Well, thank you so much for joining us today in the snow on Family Time.
Good-bye!
Oh man, it's been such a good lesson.
We talked about so many great places.
All right, Pauline, if you can pick just one, which place do you go to?
Ooh, just one?
Because it's a tie for me.
I like the ice hotel.
But the igloo with a glass ceiling also sounds amazing.
I really liked that one, too. That looked like a lot of fun.
Well, friends, we've had a lot of fun studying this with you.
And we hope you'll join us tomorrow right here on Let's Talk in English, good-bye.
