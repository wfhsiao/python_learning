Hello, welcome to Saturday at Let's Talk in English.
I'm Jay.
Thanks for taking the time to join us this weekend.
Yes. Hi, friends, I'm Pauline.
We had a great time together here on the show this week.
And now that it's Saturday, we can relax and review everything we learned.
Friends, we did learn a lot this week.
You should feel really good about that.
Your English is getting better and better.
Yes. And today you can show off everything you learned by answering some questions about the lessons.
And we'll be extra nice to you before we start asking questions.
We'll even let you watch those conversations one more time.
We will?
Yes, of course we will.
But OK, before we do that, maybe we can ask one question.
Friends, do you remember what shows we had this week, what they were about?
Oh, good question.
Yes, and Pauline, I'm sure our friends are answering that question at home.
But maybe you should answer it for us, too.
Oh, right.
OK, uh, let's see.
Yesterday we had fun with color idioms.
Yes, we did.
That was our language show for the month.
We also had this month's travel show.
And we learned about the northern lights.
So beautiful.
What about Monday and Tuesday?
We had some great shows those days, too.
Yes, we did, and what were they about?
Friends, you remember, right?
You don't need me to tell you.
Oh, of course not.
I mean they know, but we are curious if you remember.
Don't worry. I remember.
Oh, and friends, now I remember, it's time for us to watch those conversations again.
Here we go.

Hi, James! Is basketball your favorite sport?
Yes. I love basketball!
See? I have my basketball with me.
I like basketball, too.
Let's go play on the basketball court at the park.
Not now. I'm eating lunch.
OK. Well, I can practice with my team after work.
You are on a basketball team?
Yes. We're pretty good.
Do you shoot the ball a lot?
Of course!
Do you make a lot of baskets?
Not too many.
But other players on my team do.
A lot of people really like basketball.
They do.
Millions of people in the world play it.
I know. It's a very popular sport.
The first half of the game was great.
The players move so fast!
I know! It was very exciting.
Is this your first time at an NBA game?
Yes. The players are so good!
Some of the players shoot from the 3-point line.
They score a lot of points.
They're also good at handling the ball.
Well, they are NBA players.
Our team scored a lot of points in the first half.
They're playing great.
They run fast and jump high.
They must practice a lot.
I'm sure.
Every player needs practice, including NBA players.
They must practice dribbling, passing and catching the ball.
Hey, the game's about to start again.
Let's cheer for our team!
Go, team!
Hi, Susie.
What are you doing?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Look at these pictures of the northern lights.
Wow! I'd love to watch them dance in the sky.
Me, too.
They're in the sky around the North Pole.
I know.
You can also see them in many places in Scandinavia, Alaska and Canada.
I'd like to go any of those places.
Are the northern lights always green?
No. They can also be red, orange or purple.
To see them best, you need a clear, dark night.
Cool! This picture looks like a blanket of light in the sky.
The northern lights can take many forms.
They can look like that or like a laser show.
When you go and see them, I'll go with you!
﻿(Music).
Welcome to the program, Trina Travel!
Thank you, Greg.
Have you ever seen the northern lights?
No, I haven't seen them, have you?
Yes, I went to a resort in Finland last winter and saw them.
Did you have to stay up late to see them?
Yes, but I didn't have to go outside.
I could see them through the glass roof of my igloo.
That sounds really cool!
There are many amazing places to see the northern lights.
Tell us about another place.
In Churchill, Canada, you can see the lights and polar bears, too.
I'd like that.
Near Fairbanks, Alaska, you can take a northern lights tour.
That would be fun.
It would!
And in Sweden, you can see the lights and stay overnight in an ice hotel.
What an amazing experience!
I can't believe it!
What happened?
I didn't win the prize.
You mean in the contest?
Yes. I'm seeing red!
Calm down.
Don't get angry.
Our friend Sam won.
Why didn't I?
Matt, you're green with envy.
It's just not right.
I tried so hard.
I know.
But maybe he did, too.
He didn't.
So Sam's win came out of the blue?
Yes, everyone was so surprised.
Well, Sam must be tickled pink about it.
He is very happy.
At least someone is.
You can try again in the next contest.
I don't know.
This experience wasn't good.
Oh, look! Sam just posted a picture of his prize.
Oh. Now I'm really feeling blue.
What fun lessons.
All right, now friends, are you ready to answer some questions?
Great!
Friends, you answer at home, and Pauline will answer them here, OK?
So let's start with my favorite lessons.
Our sports lessons about basketball.
The ones you forget.
Well, anyways—
Friends, basketball is a popular sport.
That's right.
How many people in the world play basketball?
A lot!
Well, yes, Pauline, but you need to answer with a key word.
Oh, right.
Uh, millions.
Millions of people in the world play basketball.
Good.
Basketball isn't a game you play by yourself or just against one other person.
To play basketball, you need two—
Two teams.
Basketball is a team sport.
Great!
OK, now guess what action I'm doing.
Oh, you are throwing the ball.
Oh, yeah, Pauline, but we need a key word, remember?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, you are shooting the ball into the basket.
Hey, nice!
OK, now what am I doing?
Oh! You are—you are dribbling.
Yes! Nice.
OK, and...
What did you do that for?
Uh, so you would catch the ball, of course.
Hey, good job.
Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, and hey, thanks for cheering for me.
Oh, but hey, now let's review our travel lesson.
What did we learn about in that lesson?
Oh, we learned about the beautiful northern lights.
Yeah, so what are the northern lights?
Oh, it's an amazing light show in the night sky.
Very good.
Where can you see them?
You can see them around the North Pole, like in Scandinavia, Alaska or Canada.
OK, and when can you see the northern lights?
Hmm. January to March is a popular time to look for them.
But don't look for them during the day.
To see them best, you need a clear, dark night.
Got it.
So you need to stay up late to see them.
I'd love to see them in that resort in Finland where you can stay in an igloo with a glass roof.
That would be such a fun way to watch the northern lights.
I agree.
Well, friends, we hope you're having fun reviewing with us.
But now it's time for a quick break.
Don't go away.
