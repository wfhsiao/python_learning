Welcome back, friends.
Why do you think some people want to smoke or use e-cigarettes?
Hmm, good question. I guess some people think it looks cool.
Other people do it just because their friends are doing it.
So they want to be part of the group.
Others do it to relax or manage stress.
Those reasons make sense.
Everyone wants to look cool and have friends and relax.
But I'm not sure smoking or using e-cigarettes is the best way to do that.
Yeah, especially if they really do harm your body and create big health problems.
Actually, James and Taylor are looking up some information about that now.
Let's join them again and see what they found out.
Let's see... e-cigarettes change e-liquid into vapor.
You breathe that.
Is that bad?
Yes. Some chemicals in the vapor can cause cancer!
That's awful.
Nicotine in the vapor can also cause attention problems for teens.
Teenagers use e-cigarettes?
Yes, but they shouldn't.
They can become addicted to nicotine.
I'll tell my sister.
If she keeps using them, she may not be able to stop!
OK. So Taylor is looking at some information on her phone.
I like the first thing she says:
Let's see...
Oh, yes. I uses these two words a lot.
Let's see...
It shows you are thinking.
Maybe you are trying to remember something or you're trying to find information.
For example:
Hey, Pauline, what did you eat for breakfast yesterday?
Ooh, uh, let's see... yesterday I had toast for breakfast.
Very good.
OK, what does Taylor say next?
Oh, uh, let's see... oh, she says cigarettes change e-liquid into vapor.
OK. So if something is a liquid, it's not solid or gas.
Examples of liquid are water, oil, juice and coffee.
Right.
When you heat water, it starts to boil, and then the water changes into steam.
That's a gas or vapor.
So e-cigarettes have a liquid inside it.
The liquid is heated into vapor, so people can breathe it.
OK, but is that bad?
Yes.
Remember, the liquid inside e-cigarettes isn't just water with flavorings.
There are harmful chemicals in the liquid.
Some can even cause cancer.
Oh, that's awful.
I mean that's really serious.
Cancer is a serious disease.
People die from cancer.
Yeah, that's the most serious thing about e-cigarettes.
Although it's not the only problem.
Oh, that's right.
Taylor also said the nicotine in the vapor can also cause attention problems for teens, right?
Right.
So it might be harder to focus at school and get good grades.
I see.
But do teenagers really use e-cigarettes?
Yeah, unfortunately some do.
And nicotine is especially bad for teens.
Teens can easily become addicted to it.
Hey, Jack, can you tell us more about that?
(Chinese).
Thanks for your help, Jack.
Wow, I really learned a lot today.
Me, too.
And I'm not just talking about today's key words.
But speaking of them, let's take a moment to review those key words together now.
Friends, you can practice along with us, OK?
Here's your first key word for today.
harmless.
harmless.
These insects are harmless.
chemical.
chemical.
Are there chemicals in the water?
breathe.
breathe.
I like to breathe fresh air.
cancer.
cancer.
Nate is very sick. He has cancer.
attention.
attention.
Give me your attention.
All right, friends, thanks for paying attention.
Those are your key words.
Keen on practicing.
And now let's watch today's conversation one more time together.
What do you know about e-cigarettes, Taylor?
Not much.
Why do you ask?
My sister is trying them.
She says they're great.
Well, they look harmless.
But are they?
The e-liquid has nicotine and other chemicals in it.
Really? Isn't it mostly water and flavorings?
Let's look up e-cigarettes online and find out for sure.
Let's see... e-cigarettes change e-liquid into vapor.
You breathe that.
Is that bad?
Yes. Some chemicals in the vapor can cause cancer!
That's awful.
Nicotine in the vapor can also cause attention problems for teens.
Teenagers use e-cigarettes?
Yes, but they shouldn't.
They can become addicted to nicotine.
I'll tell my sister.
If she keeps using them, she may not be able to stop!
﻿(Music).
Hey, James, do you like to try new things?
Sure. I like to try new sports, and I like to try new food.
So it's OK to try new things, right?
Well, of course.
Wait. There are some things you shouldn't try.
What are you thinking about?
Well, some kids are trying e-cigarettes.
Ginger! Cigarettes are bad for you. You know that.
Yes. But what about e-cigarettes? They have flavors.
And they look harmless.
But they're not.
They contain harmful chemicals.
Oh no!
And you can become addicted to nicotine.
And then can't stop smoking them?
That's right.
The e-cigarettes can change e-liquids into vapors.
And you breathe the nicotine.
Oh no! Ew, that's awful.
It is.
So don't try e-cigarettes ever.
I won't!
Never, never, ever, never, ever, never!
Good.
No.
No.
﻿(Song Time).
Well, this has been a good start to this lesson.
I have to say, it's not always an easy subject to talk about, but it is important.
Well, yeah, especially because some of us—many of us maybe don't know much about e-cigarettes because they're kind of a new thing, and we have a lot of questions about them.
So I'm glad I get to learn some new things with everyone.
Exactly.
And that's why I'm glad we'll be talking about this again tomorrow.
So, friends, I hope you join us then.
We'll see you then right here on Let's Talk in English, good-bye.
