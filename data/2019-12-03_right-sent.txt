Hey friends, and welcome back.
Today we're talking about basketball.
Have you ever been to a basketball game?
I have. And so [has] Matt and Greg.
Actually, they're at one right now.
Let's rejoin them for the rest of today's conversation.
Our team scored a lot of points in the first half.
They're playing great.
They run fast and jump high.
They must practice a lot.
I'm sure.
Every player needs practice, including NBA players.
They must practice dribbling, passing and catching the ball.
Hey, the game's about to start again.
Let's cheer for our team!
Go, team!
Ooh, it sounds like Greg and Matt are watching an exciting game.
Yeah, their team scored a lot of points in the first half.
They're playing great.
So basketball games are split into two halves?
Well, sort of.
NBA games are split into four 12-minute parts.
But college basketball is a little different.
College games are only split into two 20-minute parts.
But either way, all basketball games have a halftime break.
Oh, OK. I didn't know that.
Yeah. So, actually, NBA games are 48 minutes long.
And college games are 40 minutes long.
Oh, so college games are actually a little shorter than NBA games.
Yes. And sometimes that makes them even more exciting.
College games can be really fast.
Oh, I had heard college basketball is exciting, but I never knew why.
Yeah. The shorter time is one reason.
But another reason is because college players all want to make it to the NBA.
So they play as hard as they can so that people will pick them for the NBA.
Oh, that makes sense.
They must practice a lot.
Yeah, they have to work hard on running fast and jumping high.
And of course, they practice handling the ball a lot.
Matt says some of the ways they practice handling the ball, doesn't he?
Yeah, he does.
Hmm, hey, I have an idea.
Why don't we act them out together?
OK. So the first is dribbling.
Dribbling. That's right.
That's like this.
And passing.
Oh, and catching.
Good job.
So those are all different ways of handling the ball.
Well, nice.
Friends, maybe you can practice those words at the same time as you practice those moves.
Good idea. Hey, but back to Matt and Greg.
It looks like halftime is just about over.
Yes. Greg says the game's about to start.
Oh, but before we continue further, I remember Jack wants to teach us something about that sentence.
Jack?
(Chinese).
Thanks, Jack.
So the game's about to start again.
Greg and Matt's team did well in the first half of the game.
I wonder how they'll do in the second half.
Good question.
Matt and Greg are ready to cheer them on.
Yeah. Go, team!
Let's cheer for our team.
Let's cheer for today's Calendar Phrase!
Let's cheer for our team.
Let's cheer for our team.
(Chinese).
The basketball game is about to start.
Yay! Let's cheer for our team.
This is exciting.
Let's cheer for our team.
Both teams are great.
Let's cheer for our team.
Yeah! Go Lakers!
Go Warriors!
Lakers!
Warriors!
Hmm. Go TEAM!
Let's cheer for our team.
Let's cheer for our team.
(Chinese).
Hey, actually, I wonder which team Greg and Matt are cheering for.
Oh, I don't know.
Hmm. I'll have to ask them later.
Well, friends, we've learned some really useful words today, and it's always a good idea to practice.

And now let's watch today's conversation one more time together.
The first half of the game was great.
The players move so fast!
I know! It was very exciting.
Is this your first time at an NBA game?
Yes. The players are so good.
Some of the players shoot from the 3-point line.
They score a lot of points.
They're also good at handling the ball.
Well, they are NBA players.
Our team scored a lot of points in the first half.
They're playing great.
They run fast and jump high.
They must practice a lot.
I'm sure.
Every player needs practice, including NBA players.
They must practice dribbling, passing and catching the ball.
Hey, the game's about to start again.
Let's cheer for our team.
Go, team!
﻿(Music).
Wow, basketball is exciting.
I like watching it.
So you like watching our team play?
No. I like watching the NBA team play.
They're great.
True. NBA players are so good.
Yeah, they shoot from far away and make baskets.
Yes, they score a lot of points.
They're good at handling the ball, too.
Of course! They are NBA.
Oh yeah.
And they run fast.
I can run fast, too.
Well, they jump high.
I can jump high, too.
Uh, they can pass and catch.
And I can do that, too.
I want to play on a basketball team.
Sorry, Ginger, but you can't play on my basketball team.
I don't want to play on your team. I want to be an NBA player. Oh yeah.
﻿(Music).
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Jack's File.
I'm Jack.
What is your favorite sport?
I have several favorite sports.
One of them is basketball.
I love to play and to watch it.
I'm going to go to the park and play basketball with my friends now.
But I'll see you later.
Basketball is a very popular sport.
About 300 million people play it around the world.
People play it on a basketball court.
But the court can be inside or outside.
Many parks have basketball courts.
Schools do, too.
Two teams play each other in basketball.
Each team has five players.
A team has to get the basketball into the other team's basket.
They shoot the ball at the basket.
Sometimes the ball goes through the basket.
When it does, the team gets two points.
At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins the game.
Players want to make as many baskets for their team as they can.
Baskets are usually worth two points.
But there is a line on the court.
It's called the 3-point line.
If a player makes a basket from behind that line, the player gets three points.
Besides making baskets, basketball players must be good at handling the ball.
They must dribble, pass and catch the ball.
They must run fast and jump high, too.
Basketball is an exciting game to watch.
Many people watch professional basketball.
NBA games are exciting.
Everyone cheers for their favorite players and teams.
That was a fun time.
I like to play basketball, but now I'm tired.
I think I'll watch a basketball game now.
My favorite team, the Golden State Warriors, are playing tonight.
They're really good.
Do you have a favorite NBA team?
Well, have a good day, everyone.
I'll see you next time on Jack's File.
Good-bye, everyone.
Oh, nice shot!
Yes! Two points for me.
Well, friends, this has been a lot of fun learning about basketball as well as learning some good English words for basketball.
We hope you had fun with us.
We sure did.
It even inspired Pauline and I to practice our shots a little bit.
I must say, I'm getting pretty good.
Yeah, yeah, you're not bad.
Ah, well, maybe we can practice our 3-point shots next.
Ooh, OK, but I think first we better go ahead and say good-bye.
Friends, thanks again for joining us today.
We hope to see you tomorrow right here on Let's Talk in English, good-bye.
