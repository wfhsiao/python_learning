Welcome back, friends.
Do you like basketball?
Do you watch basketball on TV?
Or do you play on a team?
That's what we're talking about today—basketball.
Basketball is a sport that millions of people enjoy around the world.
That's right.
And that's what James and Taylor are talking about today, too.
Why don't we go back to them and their conversation now?
Do you shoot the ball a lot?
Of course!
Do you make a lot of baskets?
Not too many.
But other players on my team do.
A lot of people really like basketball.
They do.
Millions of people in the world play it.
I know.
It's a very popular sport.
Hey, Pauline, I think we should take a minute to talk about the different words we use to talk about the actions in basketball.
OK, sure. What's first?
Well, Taylor asked James if he shoots the ball a lot.
When you shoot the ball, you throw it up towards the basket.
OK, that's right.
You can also say you make a shot.
Oh, good point.
And if your shot is good, if it goes in, then you can say that you made a basket.
Yes, that's right.
Hey, let's talk about that word, basket, because basket actually has two meanings, doesn't it?
Oh, that's true.
The thing that you shoot at is called the basket.
But when you actually shoot the ball through that basket, we also call it a basket.
Right. Did you shoot the ball through the basket? Oh, then you made a basket.
And that's what Taylor asked James.
Do you make a lot of baskets?
James said that he doesn't make too many, but I think he's just being humble.
They are pretty good, apparently.
I guess so.
Hey, Pauline, I was thinking now we should probably teach our friends how to play that game, Horse.
What do you think?
Ooh, yeah, let's do it.
Well, we don't have a basketball court or even a basketball, but we'll just pretend, right?
All right. Let's do it.
OK, so why don't I start?
I'm going to make a shot, and if I make it, she has to make that same shot.
I'm going to shoot from right here and—Oh! But I missed! Ohh.
Yes! All right, that means it's my turn.
I get to pick where to shoot from.
I'm going to pick here.
OK.
All right, making the shot.
Ah! Got it!
Whoa! Nice shot.
All right, you have to make the same shot now.
That's right.
Friends, I'd better not miss.
Here we go.
Oh! I missed, though.
Yes! So that means you have an H for horse.
That's right.
I have to say H.
And if I make four more mistakes, it's O, R, S, E.
If I say the word "horse," then I'm out of the game.
But luckily for you, there's not any time to play anymore.
That's true.
Well, that was a fun example of one type of game you can play with a basketball.
Millions of people love to play basketball.
Yeah. And millions of people also want to know what Jack has to say about that.
Take it away, Jack.

Here's your second question.
Do you like basketball?
Do you like basketball?
Let's hear some answers from our friends.
Do I like basketball?
Well, of course, I love all kinds of sports.
But I like basketball because you can take the ball in your hands and throw it really hard at somebody, just like this.
Wait a minute. That's not basketball.
I told you before I'm no good at sports.
I'm good at English and super sentences.
Do I like basketball?
No, not really because I love basketball.
I love watching basketball and playing the sport.
It's a fast-paced game and it requires a lot of skill.
Whether you're dribbling, passing or shooting the ball, practice makes perfect.
And when the professionals do it, it's so much fun to watch their amazing shooting and dunks.
Do I like basketball?
Uh, sure.
I mean I don't dislike it.
Although I don't really play basketball.
It's been a long time since I played any kind of basketball game.
And I don't really watch basketball, either, on TV.
I don't really like watching sports on TV.
But I do think it's fun to go to a professional basketball game if you can.
I've done that a couple times, and that's a lot of fun.
So I like that kind of basketball.
Do I like basketball?
I sure do.
I like watching it.
Basketball is exciting.
Millions of people like watching it. And lots of people like playing basketball, too. It's so much fun.
You jump and you run and you shoot the baskets.
And maybe you'll get two points or even three!
I love basketball. Don't you?
Well, friends, thanks for joining us today.
We hope you'll join us again tomorrow, too.
We have lots more to learn about this fun sport.
And of course, we'll learn some good key words together then, too.
In the meantime, don't forget to answer this question at home, all right?
We'll see you tomorrow right here on Let's Talk in English, good-bye.
