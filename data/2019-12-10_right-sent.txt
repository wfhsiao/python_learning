Welcome back, friends.
What are gas stations like where you live?
Do you have to pump the gas yourself?
Is there usually a convenience store with the gas station?
And does gas cost the same at all of the different stations?
Or are some gas stations cheaper than others?
Every country has gas stations, but they aren't all the same.
And it's fun to think about those differences.
Well, today our friends Taylor and Greg are at a gas station in the U.S.
Let's see how they're doing.
Do you want anything besides that?
Yes. Get me something salty, like chips.
All right.
A hot dog and chips.
Do you want a soft drink, too?
No, thanks. I have my water bottle.
I'll get some juice and a candy bar.
Buy me a candy bar, too.
I need something sweet.
OK. Let's go!
Oh, right, Taylor and Greg are planning the food they want to buy at the gas station.
Right. Greg is going to pump gas while Taylor runs in and buys them food.
Greg wants a hot dog, but maybe that's not enough for a full meal.
Right. So Taylor says, "Do you want anything besides that?"
She could also say, "Do you want anything else?"
Both questions mean about the same thing.
Hey, let's practice using those questions.
Uh, let's pretend I'm at a restaurant and Pauline is the waitress.
Oh, OK.
Ahem. Hello, sir, what can I get you?
I'd like spaghetti, please.
Do you want anything else?
Oh, yes, I'd like a drink with that, please.
Great. Do you want anything besides that?
Oh, yes, actually, I'd like some soup.
Great. Do you want anything besides that?
Hmm, no, thanks.
Wait! Yes, I want today's Calendar Phrase!
Do you want anything besides that?
Do you want anything besides that?
(Chinese).
What do you want for lunch?
I want a hog dog.
Do you want anything besides that?
I also want a soft drink.
Do you want anything besides that?
I also want French fries.
And...
Sorry. That's all you get.
Nothing besides that?
Do you want anything besides that?
Do you want anything besides that?
(Chinese).
Oh, yeah, what else does Greg want besides a hot dog?
He also wants something salty, like chips.
Yum. I do love chips, although they aren't very healthy.
No. But gas stations usually aren't a good place to get a healthy lunch.
Oh, that's true.
Oh, but hey, at least Greg isn't getting a soda.
Taylor offered to get him a soft drink, but Craig said, "No, thanks."
He has his own water bottle.
Oh, good for him.
Oh, but what is Taylor going to get?
Oh, she's going to get some juice and a candy bar.
Wait. What? That's a terrible lunch!
Yeah. Hopefully, she packs some other food in the car.
But when Greg hears that Taylor wants a candy bar, he decides that he wants one, too!
Oh, it is hard to say no to something sweet.
I agree.
Hey, Jack, don't you have something to say about that, too?
(Chinese).
Thanks, Jack.
Oh man, all of this talk about food made me hungry.
Me, too.
But Pauline, would you rather have a sweet snack or a salty snack?
Ooh, I don't know.
I do like anything sweet.
But I think right now I'm craving something salty.
Oh, hey, craving.
That's a fun word.
We usually use this word with food.
When you really want a special food or a drink, you can say, "I'm craving it."
For example, I'm craving chocolate.
Well, friends, I understand if you are craving some junk food after today's show.
But don't go anywhere yet.
We still need to review.
Here's your first key word for today.
salty.
salty.
This food is so salty.
snack.
snack.
Sara ate all of her snacks.
soft drink.
soft drink.
Coke is a soft drink.
hot dog.
hot dog.
The man ate 10 hot dogs!
besides.
besides.
I have several games besides this one.
All right, friends, those are your key words for today.
There are no others besides those.
And now it's time to watch today's conversation one more time together.
Are you ready, Greg?
We should leave soon.
Yes, everything is already in the car.
But we need to stop for gas.
What about lunch?
Let's get some snacks at the gas station convenience store.
OK. I'll run in and buy some while you pump the gas.
What do you what?
I want a hot dog.
Do you want anything besides that?
Yes. Get me something salty, like chips.
All right.
A hot dog and chips.
Do you want a soft drink, too?
No, thanks. I have my water bottle.
I'll get some juice and a candy bar.
Buy me a candy bar, too.
I need something sweet.
OK. Let's go!
﻿(Music).
That was fun.
Yes. First, we stopped at the gas station.
Yeah, you washed the windshield.
I like a clean windshield.
And then you checked the tires.
Yes, I remembered to do that.
Then you pumped the gas.
Oh, yes.
And then we went to the supermarket.
We got all kinds of snacks.
Oh, salty and sweet.
We bought drinks, too.
Soft drinks, coffee, hot dogs, hamburgers and pizza.
Yeah. The car is full of gas.
And we're full of snacks.
That was really fun.
Oops!
Is something wrong?
Yeah. We forget to buy bananas!
Oh! Ahh!
Oh.
We have to go again.
Yeah, let's go back.
﻿(Music).
Hello, everyone.
I'm Jack, and this is Jack's File.
I'm going to drive my car and do a few things around town.
But first, I have to go to a gas station.
My car is almost out of gas.
See you later.
At a gas station, you can fill your car with gas.
You can wash your car's windshield.
You can also wash your cars other windows.
You can check the air in your tires, too.
In some places, someone at the gas station helps you.
In others, you pump your own gas.
In the United States, you pay before you pump gas.
You can pay with a credit card at the pump.
You can find gas stations in many places around town.
To put gas to your car, you pull your car up to the pump and fill it with gas.
It doesn't take long.
Most gas stations have convenient stores.
If you don't have a credit card, you go into the store to pay for your gas.
You can also buy all kinds of salty and sweet snacks.
When people buy gas, they often buy snacks and drinks to enjoy in their car.
Both soft drinks and coffee are popular.
Some gas stations also sell hot food.
You can buy hot dogs, hamburgers and pizza.
Besides food, many places sell lottery tickets and many other things.
It's fun to look around in a gas station store.
Hello again.
I'm back.
I stopped at the gas station and filled up my car with gas.
Now I have plenty of gas.
I can drive anywhere.
I also bought some snacks at the convenience store.
I'll eat them while I watch basketball.
I'll see you next time on Jack's File.
Good-bye, everyone.
Well, Jay, before we finish up our two shows on going to the gas station, would you like to hear a funny confession?
OK, yeah, sure.
I do have a bad habit of not going to the gas station when I really should, when my car's gas tank is really low, close to empty.
OK, so—
So you can probably guess where this is going.
You ended up on the side of the road, didn't you?
Yeah, my car wouldn't go.
It's just stuck on the side of the road without any gas.
I had to call my husband a couple different times.
Oh no!
Anyways, friends, thanks for joining us today.
We'll see you tomorrow right here on Let's Talk in English, good-bye.
﻿(Music).
