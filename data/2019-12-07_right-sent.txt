Welcome back, friends.
Hey, we still need to review our lesson about color idioms.
Exactly.
So let's do that now with a lightning review.
Ooh, OK, friends, remember, that means it's a fast review.
You will get, uh, 30 seconds to guess as many key words from the lesson as possible.
All right, ready?
On your marks, get set, go!
OK, so I've got a color here, and I...
Oh, you are...
You are angry.
You are mad.
You are seeing red!
That's right.
OK, good job. OK, next one.
Let's see... uh, let's do this.
Ooh, hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm. I think you are green with envy.
That's right.
OK, let's do this one.
You are tickled pink.
That's right.
Oh. (Quick, quick, quick!)
The last one.
Oh, you are blue.
Ooh, and time's up out of the blue.
Haha! Yeah.
Well, friends, that was a good review.
Hope you got some of those.
Now let's go to our features.
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Jack's File.
I'm Jack.
What is your favorite sport?
I have several favorite sports.
One of them is basketball.
I love to play and to watch it.
I'm going to go to the park and play basketball with my friends now.
But I'll see you later.
Basketball is a very popular sport.
About 300 million people play it around the world.
People play it on a basketball court.
But the court can be inside or outside.
Many parks have basketball courts.
Schools do, too.
Two teams play each other in basketball.
Each team has five players.
A team has to get the basketball into the other team's basket.
They shoot the ball at the basket.
Sometimes the ball goes through the basket.
When it does, the team gets two points.
At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins the game.
Players want to make as many baskets for their team as they can.
Baskets are usually worth two points.
But there is a line on the court.
It's called the 3-point line.
If a player makes a basket from behind that line, the player gets three points.
Besides making baskets, basketball players must be good at handling the ball.
They must dribble, pass and catch the ball.
They must run fast and jump high, too.
Basketball is an exciting game to watch.
Many people watch professional basketball.
NBA games are exciting.
Everyone cheers for their favorite players and teams.
That was a fun time.
I like to play basketball, but now I'm tired.
I think I'll watch a basketball game now.
My favorite team, the Golden State Warriors, are playing tonight.
They're really good.
Do you have a favorite NBA team?
Well, have a good day, everyone.
I'll see you next time on Jack's File.
Good-bye, everyone.

Family Time.
Hello, friends!
Today we are in the snow.
Now why are we in the snow? Because it is winter!
We are going to play in the snow today.
Join us on Family Time.
Kai Kai!
In the winter, there's often snow.
Snow is beautiful.
It is clean and white.
And it is cold.
Because it is cold, we have to wear warm clothes.
Everyone is getting dressed to go outside.
We are going to play in the snow.
Now it takes a long time to get dressed because there are a lot of clothes to put on.
Kai Kai, do you have everything?
I think I have everything.
Wait! I need my gloves.
Thank you.
I need a hat.
Oh, thank you.
OK, let's go outside.
Let's go! Yay! Ooh-hoo!
Playing in the snow can be a lot of fun.
People can do many things in the snow.
You can make snow balls and throw them.
Or you can make a snowman.
Mei Mei, what are you doing?
I'm making a snow angel.
Wow. Even though it's cold outside, there are still many fun things we can do out here in the snow.
Whoa! Hey! Who threw that snow ball?
Levi!
In the wintertime, many people enjoy doing different kinds of sports.
Many people enjoy skiing and snowboarding down hills and mountains.
Other people like to skate on the ice.
It is a lot of fun to be outside in the snow.
It is now time to go inside and drink something warm.
Whoa. Well, I am tired, but we had a lot of fun out in the snow today.
Now it's time for us to enjoy a nice warm cup of hot chocolate.
Well, thank you so much for joining us today in the snow on Family Time.
Good-bye!

How about you?
Just for fun, can you give me the super sentence in another way?
Uh, OK, sure.

Like I said, it was great.
It was super!
That was a super sentence.
Nice job.
A super sentence every day will make your English great.
So what's so funny?
It's this picture. Look at the face he's making and the wig he's wearing.
Oh, wait a minute. Yeah, that fake hair is pretty funny.
You know, the longer you look at this picture, the funnier it is.
It's—OK, guys, guys, that's not me.
What?
That's—that's not—that's not—it's someone else's face.
That's my face.
It's not my face.
It's not a funny face.
This is not your funny face?
No, that's not a wig.
That's real hair.
It's not your hair?
It's not a real wig?
No, it's—that's my grandmother.
What?
Whom I love and miss very much.
Oh!
Uh, well, um, she's—
Beautiful.
Yes, she is.
Oh, um, you have her smile.
Oh, stop.
Those features were great.
They are a fun way to learn and practice English, don't you think?
I sure do.
So, Pauline, do you have any plans now for the rest of your weekend?
Not really.
I think I'm just going to relax.
Oh, and finish putting up my Christmas decorations.
Oh, I guess I should start putting up a few, too.
You should!
Well, friends, we hope you enjoyed reviewing with us today.
And we'll have a whole new week of shows ready for you on Monday.
